# HCX_assesment
Here lies my solutions for the given challenge.

## Used Technologies
- **Cypress**: Web applications test framework, popular for it's intuitive usage, versatility and test execution UI;
- **Cucumber**: Traditional BDD testing tool that has Gherkin as base;
- **JavaScript**: Coding language chosen for this assessment, very popular for UI automated tests using Cypress.

## Getting Started
Be sure to install:
- **Node.js**;
- **npm**;
- An IDE of your choice (for example **Visual Studio Code** or **WebStorm**).

## Setting the Environment
1. **Using your IDE terminal, use git commands to clone this repository:**
  ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/JayDeAlmeida/HCX_assesment
  ```

2.  **Navigate to the project's directory:**
   ```bash
   cd HCX_assesment
  ```

3. **Install needed dependencies:**
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```


## Test Execution
1. **Using Cypress UI**
  In order to open Cypress' UI run the following command:
  ```bash
  npx cypress open
  ```

2. **Running tests on terminal**
   If you don't want to run Cypress' UI, you can run the test and see the logs and results on your terminal by running the following         command:
 ```bash
 npx cypress run
 ```

## API Tests Reports
In order to have a call history for the API automated test, a report file was created. All the runs results are automatically storaged within the file:
```bash
trello_api_report.json
```
